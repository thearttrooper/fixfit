FixFit
======

Ever forgotten to pause your Garmin GPS ride tracker? I have. I was
left with a profile with long zero speed periods. I created FixFit to
fix this problem. It eliminates zero speed (where zero is considered
anything less than 3mph) trackpoints and rewrites the time line
preserving the delta between good trackpoints. It also resets the
total ride time.
